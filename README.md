*Players will use two decks of cards for this endeavor for a total of 104 Spurrs. Including Jokers!*

*Future Developments*
- In Depth Character cards that creates RPG like gameplay
  +Players will take the role of an investor within the Gazbee Universe with directions on how to act and play the game

- Interacting Industry Spurrs
  + ATM there are only direct Spurrs. Oil plays on Oil... In a coming update there will be a Negative AGR from Oil. Graphic Design is tiring.
 
- Table Top Simulator
  + An online tool that allows you to play the game virtually! I have to add all my resources on to it.
 
- The Board
  +More art to make and more adjustments to the movement
 
- Lots more I'm sure. I kinda just have so much going on here I forget what is needed to be added but I know you can play it and that's good enough for now.


Thank you for joining me here. I hope you enjoy what you see [:^)
